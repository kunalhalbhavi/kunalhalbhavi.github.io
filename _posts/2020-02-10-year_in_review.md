# A year in review ... 2019

## So,how was the year 2019?

 Good.The year started with,a journey !.Yes,the journey that every body in family awaited long.By,long I mean years of years.I was hardly 8,when I visited my native place.I remember it was my summer vacations.Since,then I never visited to my village.Because,I got busy with the formal schooling with the increasing standards,high school and college.
 
 But then,in 2019  I managed to quit my job and decided to give a pause to my career, that just took off in 2016,that was almost two years.The reason I risked my career, was the health of my grand father and mother.I thought of why not give priority to them as there is no guarantee of life.Let give them the opportunity to see me and spend some time together before they die! Well,the journey was memorable,had lots of family time together.
 
 Then started the after effects of quitting a job all of a sudden.There was a gap of one full month in my resume.I started to give a lift to my 'paused' career once again.One month was passed already,& the second was about to end.I got a call from a company,located in Vadodara,the city away from my home town.All went good,I cracked the interview and decided to join the company.I was desperate to join any company at that time as I was already running financially out.

There were couple of challenges for me including to live away from my home town,working in night shift that I never did in my entire life span.Gradually, I learnt to live away from family,working in shift,eating food that was of no match to the home cooked.All these things happened,along with the fact that I was working for a profile that I was not interested at all.It was a support work with no learning.Just fire some sql queries,prepare some excel,debug the code and do some modification.

It seemed that the fortune was in favour of me as,the project on which I gave support,the client was about to terminate the contract.That was a hope for me,to escape from what I hated.There was a fear in me,of what next ? There was a firm denial by me to stay associated with the company for a long time.

I then got recommendation for another company in Vadodara itself,by my TL itself.I got selected in that too,but couldn't decide if I should join it or not.Lot's of questions aroused in my mind like I already had months of gap in resume,already had six months of experience prior the visit to my village and another six months of short experience would literally spoil my resume.I had two ways- the one was to accept the offer of same company to work was a different profile and other was to leave and join the startup company.I chose the later one.

Chosing the later one was like no salary growth for another one year,but  learning and developing new skills were the payback of the loss,the time and energy that got wasted.

The year ended with no  additional skill,no achievement,with an excuse that the new year will be a good start to develop a better me, a better self.
