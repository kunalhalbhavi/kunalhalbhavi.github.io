# Improving 2020

## So,now what's next? 

Ah. The year 2020 started with a hope to be a more better version of me.Looking behind, I realized that much of my time after the graduation got wasted.No new skills learnt,no challenges were challenged,no thrill to live the life at all.Simply just lived the life for the mere sake of living.

Well,not wasting more time on the past that couldn't be changed,I decided to concentrate on present and how good,better and best of can I make year 2020? 

How should I work on my self,my potentials,my weaknesses?

I don't know from where to start,what to pick,all I know is the absence of action that has always held me back and been an obstacle in my progress.
